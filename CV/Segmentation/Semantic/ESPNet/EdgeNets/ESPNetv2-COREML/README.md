# Real-time semantic segmentation using ESPNetv2 on iPhone

This repository provides **a real-time demo** of [ESPNetv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11431) on iPhone (tested only on iPhone7). Below are some illustrations.

## Model details
The COREML ESPNetv2 model takes an RGB image of size 256x256 as an input and produces an output of size 256x256 in **real-tim**. The model learns about `0.79 million parameters` and performs roughly `337 million FLOPs` to generate the segmentation mask. The model is trained using PyTorch on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and achieves a segmentation score of `63.36`, which is measured in terms of mean interesection over union (mIOU). 

Several pre-trained models are provided in our [EdgeNets](https://github.com/sacmehta/EdgeNets) repository.
